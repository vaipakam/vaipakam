/**
 * @title  DiamondFacetNames
 * @notice Single source of truth for the set of facets cut into the
 *         Vaipakam Diamond — consumed by every test in the `test/deploy/`
 *         deploy-sanity suite so the suite's facet lists cannot drift
 *         apart from one another.
 *
 * @dev    Mirrors the `cuts[]` array of `script/DeployDiamond.s.sol`.
 *         When a facet is added to or removed from the Diamond, update
 *         `cutFacetNames()` here — and only here — and both the EIP-170
 *         size guardrail and the selector-coverage guardrail pick the
 *         change up. Keeping the list in one place is deliberate: a
 *         per-test hand-list would let a facet escape one guardrail
 *         while still passing the other.
 *
 *         `DiamondCutFacet` is intentionally NOT in this list: it is
 *         installed by the `VaipakamDiamond` constructor, not via a
 *         `_get*Selectors()` cut list. `FacetSizeLimitTest` size-checks
 *         it as an explicit extra; `SelectorCoverageTest` does not
 *         selector-check it (it has no hand-maintained cut list that
 *         could drift).
