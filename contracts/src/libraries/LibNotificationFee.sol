/**
 * @title LibNotificationFee
 * @notice T-032 — pricing + collection helpers for the per-loan-side
 *         notification tariff. Charged in VPFI from the user's vault on
 *         the FIRST PaidPush-tier notification fired by the off-chain
 *         watcher Worker.
 *
 *         Recycling M1 (#1346, `VpfiRecyclingBalanceGovernorDesign.md`
 *         §4.1 Layer 0 / §5 / §13 / §14.2). Two changes from the T-032
 *         original:
 *           1. **Flat native-VPFI tariff.** The stored `notificationFee`
 *              IS the VPFI wei amount billed — a quantity, not a
 *              numeraire figure converted through the ETH/numeraire oracle
 *              and the `VPFI_PER_ETH_FIXED_PHASE1` peg. The launch-era
 *              conversion class (§14.2) is forbidden, so the peg path is
 *              retired here; `vpfiAmountForFee()` now reads the flat
 *              tariff directly.
 *           2. **Custody re-route into the recycle loop.** The bill no
 *              longer moves user-vault → treasury directly. It pulls the
 *              VPFI into **Diamond custody** and credits the recycle
 *              bucket via `LibVpfiRecycle.credit(NotificationFee, …)` —
 *              the first live non-forfeit absorption class. The tokens
 *              stay in Diamond custody as protocol-owned recycled reward
 *              runway (governor §5), never routed to treasury.
 *
 * @dev Library, delegatecalled from `LoanFacet.markNotifBilled` (the
 *      `NOTIF_BILLER_ROLE`-gated external entry). `address(this)`
 *      resolves to the Diamond inside any function below.
 *
 *      Bucket-separation invariant (governor §5) holds by construction:
 *      the tariff arrives FRESH from a user's vault, so crediting it never
 *      grows the ledger's right-hand side past the Diamond balance — the
 *      `credit()` chokepoint additionally enforces this
 *      (`InsufficientRecycleBacking` reverts if the tokens are not on the
 *      Diamond), which is why the withdraw MUST precede the credit.
 *
 *      Discount restamp (#973 / "L26"): moving VPFI out of a user's vault
 *      must re-stamp their time-weighted discount accumulator at the
 *      post-mutation balance — otherwise the payer keeps a stale
 *      fee-tier/staking stamp on VPFI that has already left. Every other
 *      VPFI-debit path does this; the pre-M1 bill path skipped it. The
 *      re-route closes that gap with a `rollupUserDiscount` tail.
