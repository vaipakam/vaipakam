/**
 * @title LoanFacet
 * @author Vaipakam Developer Team
 * @notice Loan initiation and read-side queries for the Vaipakam P2P lending
 *         platform.
 * @dev Part of the Diamond Standard (EIP-2535). Reached only as a cross-facet
 *      call from {OfferFacet.acceptOffer} (enforced via
 *      msg.sender == address(this); direct calls revert
 *      UnauthorizedCrossFacetCall).
 *
 *      Responsibilities on initiation:
 *        1. Re-verify liquidity of both lending and collateral assets on-chain
 *           (offer-stored values are not trusted).
 *        2. Require the combined abnormal-market + illiquid-assets
 *           fallback consent from both counterparties (creator-side latched on
 *           the offer, acceptor-side passed in at accept time); when either
 *           leg is illiquid and the combined consent is missing, revert
 *           NonLiquidAsset. Lender-sale vehicle offers bypass this and the
 *           LTV/HF gates below (they carry no real collateral).
 *        3. Enforce LTV ≤ assetRiskParams.loanInitMaxLtvBps and HF ≥ 1.5e18 for
 *           fully-liquid loans; skipped when the combined fallback consent is
 *           latched, since illiquid collateral is valued at $0 per README.
 *        4. For NFT-asset loans, compute prepaid rental amount and
 *           RENTAL_BUFFER_BPS buffer.
 *        5. Flip the offer creator's existing position NFT to LoanInitiated
 *           and mint the counterparty's NFT.
 *      Pausable (whenNotPaused).
