/**
 * @title VPFIDiscountFacet
 * @author Vaipakam Developer Team
 * @notice Phase 1 borrower VPFI discount mechanism — spec in
 *         docs/BorrowerVPFIDiscountMechanism.md.
 * @dev Five user-facing surfaces:
 *        1. `buyVPFIWithETH()` — fixed-rate purchase that credits VPFI to
 *           the buyer's WALLET. This function is the canonical-chain leg
 *           only; users on mirror chains reach it transparently via the
 *           `VPFIBuyAdapter` → `VPFIBuyReceiver` LayerZero round-trip (the
 *           adapter is a separate contract, not part of the Diamond). Per
 *           spec, escrow funding is a separate explicit user step on every
 *           chain regardless of how the buy was routed.
 *        2. `depositVPFIToEscrow(amount)` — explicit wallet → escrow move.
 *           Required on every chain: on canonical (Base) immediately after
 *           buying, or on non-canonical chains once the OFT return leg
 *           (or a manual bridge via the LayerZero OFT widget) lands VPFI
 *           in the user's wallet.
 *        3. `withdrawVPFIFromEscrow(amount)` — counterpart of (2). Unstakes
 *           escrow VPFI back to the caller's wallet and checkpoints staking
 *           accrual before the balance change.
 *        4. `quoteVPFIDiscount(offerId)` / `quoteVPFIDiscountFor(id, user)`
 *           — views used by the frontend to show the VPFI that will be
 *           deducted at accept time.
 *        5. `setVPFIDiscountConsent(bool)` / `getVPFIDiscountConsent(user)`
 *           — the single platform-level user setting that governs whether
 *           escrowed VPFI may be spent on protocol-fee discounts. This same
 *           flag governs BOTH the borrower Loan Initiation Fee discount
 *           (consumed in OfferFacet._acceptOffer) and the lender Yield
 *           Fee discount. No per-offer or per-call opt-in exists.
 *
 *      Admin surface (ADMIN_ROLE, matches VPFITokenFacet's pattern):
 *        - `setVPFIBuyRate(weiPerVpfi)` — rate at which ETH is accepted.
 *        - `setVPFIBuyCaps(globalCap, perWalletCap)` — global + wallet caps.
 *        - `setVPFIBuyEnabled(bool)` — kill-switch for the buy path.
 *        - `setVPFIDiscountETHPriceAsset(asset)` — WETH address (Chainlink
 *          oracle) used for the USD→ETH leg of the quote.
 *
 *      Chain scope:
 *        - Fixed-rate BUY is implemented on the canonical chain (Base) —
 *          that is where the reserve lives and where this function is
 *          callable. User-facing, however, the spec exposes a
 *          preferred-chain buy page: mirror-chain users reach this
 *          function transparently through the
 *          `VPFIBuyAdapter` → `VPFIBuyReceiver` LayerZero round-trip and
 *          receive VPFI back in their wallet on the chain they started
 *          from. No manual chain-switch or bridge step is required of
 *          the user before calling `depositVPFIToEscrow`.
 *        - The DISCOUNT itself (escrow VPFI → treasury at acceptance) works
 *          on every chain, gated purely on borrower escrow VPFI balance.
 *
 *      Reserve model: the diamond SELLS VPFI from its own balance (no
 *      mint-on-demand). Ops must fund the diamond during canonical deploy
 *      (e.g. owner mints to diamond via TreasuryFacet.mintVPFI). The caps
 *      enforce the invariant — the total ever sold at fixed rate never
 *      exceeds the effective global cap ({LibVaipakam.cfgVpfiFixedGlobalCap};
 *      default 2.3M VPFI per docs/TokenomicsTechSpec.md §8).
 *
 *      Security: `buyVPFIWithETH` and `depositVPFIToEscrow` are
 *      reentrancy-guarded and pausable. The discount path in OfferFacet
 *      inherits that facet's guards.
