/**
 * @title OfferCreateFacet
 * @author Vaipakam Developer Team
 * @notice Creation of lending and borrowing offers for the Vaipakam P2P
 *         lending platform. The acceptance half lives in
 *         `OfferAcceptFacet` — `OfferFacet` was split in two (Issue #67)
 *         for EIP-170 contract-size headroom.
 * @dev Part of the Diamond Standard (EIP-2535). Reentrancy-guarded, pausable.
 *
 *      Supports three asset forms on each leg (principal and collateral):
 *      ERC-20, ERC-721 (rental), ERC-1155 (rental, fractional quantity).
 *      NFT rentals carry a borrower prepay of `amount * durationDays` plus a
 *      `RENTAL_BUFFER_BPS` (5%) buffer; daily pro-rata deduction happens in
 *      RepayFacet, buffer is swept at resolution time.
 *
 *      Compliance surface:
 *        - Country-pair check via {LibVaipakam.canTradeBetween} using
 *          ProfileFacet-stored user countries. **Phase 1**: `canTradeBetween`
 *          always returns true — country-pair sanctions are disabled at the
 *          protocol level; the call site is retained for zero-migration
 *          re-activation in Phase 2.
 *        - Tiered KYC (README §16) — transaction value in USD is computed
 *          from the liquid leg(s) and checked against
 *          {ProfileFacet.meetsKYCRequirement} for both counterparties.
 *        - Mandatory mutual consent on every create + accept —
 *          `creatorRiskAndTermsConsent` on the offer and
 *          `acceptorRiskAndTermsConsent` at accept time. The consent covers the
 *          combined abnormal-market + illiquid-assets fallback terms
 *          (docs/WebsiteReadme.md §"Offer and acceptance risk warnings",
 *          README.md §"Liquidity & Asset Classification"). Required on
 *          every offer regardless of leg liquidity — illiquid legs would
 *          additionally fail the LTV/HF gates without it, but consent is
 *          always gathered.
 *
 *      On accept, initiates the loan via cross-facet call to
 *      {LoanFacet.initiateLoan} and auto-completes any linked lender-sale
 *      vehicle ({EarlyWithdrawalFacet.completeLoanSale}) or borrower-offset
 *      offer ({PrecloseFacet.completeOffset}) atomically.
