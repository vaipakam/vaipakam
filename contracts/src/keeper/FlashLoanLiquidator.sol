/**
 * @title  FlashLoanLiquidator
 * @author Vaipakam Developer Team
 * @notice Reference flash-loan-funded receiver for Vaipakam's
 *         discount-path liquidation
 *         (`RiskFacet.triggerLiquidationDiscounted`). Borrows the
 *         outstanding principal asset from Aave V3 or Balancer V2,
 *         pays it to the Vaipakam diamond at oracle-priced
 *         debt-plus-discount value, receives the borrower's
 *         collateral at the per-tier discount, swaps the collateral
 *         back to principal on an off-chain-ranked DEX, repays the
 *         flash-loan + fee, and forwards the net profit to the
 *         keeper-bot EOA.
 *
 * @dev    Phase 3 of `docs/DesignsAndPlans/FlashLoanLiquidationPath.md`.
 *         Deployed per chain (one address per chain) alongside the
 *         keeper bot in `apps/keeper`. The contract is owner-gated
 *         on the *entry point* — only the bot's EOA can initiate a
 *         flash-loan-funded liquidation — to prevent a griefer
 *         from triggering tx-spam costs against us. The underlying
 *         discount-path call to the diamond is permissionless, so
 *         external MEV liquidators can write their own equivalent
 *         receiver (e.g. against Aave's own ParaSwap-style sweeper
 *         or any custom flash-loan provider) and compete against
 *         our bot in the open-market.
 *
 *         Layout:
 *           - `liquidateViaAaveV3` / `liquidateViaBalancerV2` —
 *             owner-only entry points, choose flash-loan provider.
 *           - `executeOperation` — Aave V3 callback shape.
 *           - `receiveFlashLoan` — Balancer V2 callback shape.
 *           - `_runLiquidation` — shared post-flash-loan flow:
 *             approve the diamond, trigger the discounted
 *             liquidation, swap the seized collateral back to the
 *             principal asset via owner-supplied calldata.
 *           - `withdraw` / `rescueToken` — owner can pull profits
 *             OR rescue stuck tokens.
 *
 *         Reentrancy: each flash-loan provider's callback runs
 *         INSIDE that provider's flash-loan code path, so re-entry
 *         from outside is naturally blocked while the loan is open.
 *         The `_inFlight` flag also blocks a malicious nested
 *         `triggerLiquidationDiscounted` from re-entering one of
 *         our entry points (defence-in-depth — the diamond's
 *         `ReentrancyGuard` already covers this).
 *
 *         Security notes:
 *           - Aave V3 + Balancer V2 callbacks validate
 *             `msg.sender` against the configured provider, AND
 *             validate the in-flight flag — both have to align
 *             for the callback to execute. An attacker calling
 *             our `executeOperation` directly will hit the
 *             `_inFlight` guard.
 *           - Swap calldata is provided OFF-CHAIN by the keeper
 *             bot (e.g. 0x v2 / 1inch v6 quote). The contract
 *             validates the post-swap balance covers the
 *             flash-loan repayment; insufficient balance reverts
 *             the whole tx (including the discounted-liquidation
 *             call — borrower state is preserved).
 *           - `swapTarget` and `swapAllowanceTarget` are
 *             owner-supplied per-call (not stored) so the bot can
 *             route via different aggregators per loan.
