# D1 cutover — `vaipakam-archive` → `vaipakam-warm`

**Status:** planned, not executed.

**Owner decisions (2026-08-03):**
1. Proceed with the cutover — the platform is pre-live.
2. **Do not migrate the data.** Fresh contract deployments are expected, so
   the new database starts empty and captures new data only.

That second decision is what makes this document short. Earlier revisions
carried a quiesce, a whole-database export/import, a reconciliation and a
secure-destruction step for a file full of personal data. None of that is
needed to move to an empty database, and every one of those steps was a
place to get it wrong.

## 0. About the commands in this document

**There are deliberately few, and that is the second attempt at getting this
right.** An earlier structure spelled out every step as copy-paste shell and
accumulated a defect per round for three rounds: a variable used before
assignment, a `cd` leaking into the next block, a bare `npx` from a directory
with no wrangler, and — in the very commit that declared the class closed — a
`curl` using `CF_ACCOUNT_ID` and `CF_API_TOKEN` that nothing ever assigns.

The cause was not carelessness in any one line. It was writing a large
surface of shell that nobody executes. So the surface is now small: this
document states **what to do, in what order, and how to know it worked**, and
defers the exact invocations to procedures that already exist and are already
verified —

- `docs/ops/OffChainRestore.md` §1 for wrangler forms, including the
  `"triggers": { "crons": [] }` shape and the trigger-aware readback;
- `docs/ops/DeploymentRunbook.md` for the per-Worker deploy commands;
- `apps/keeper/README.md` for the kill-switch and its confirmation.

Where a command does appear here it is marked **[run]** if that exact form
was executed against the live account on 2026-08-03, or **[unrun]** if it was
written but not executed. That distinction is the honest one, and it is the
one the defect history above argues for: treat an unrun line as a description
of intent to check against the canonical runbook, not as something to paste
into a terminal during an irreversible operation.

Note also that `ops/offchain-data-warm` is **outside the pnpm workspace** — a
root install does not populate its `node_modules`, so `npx wrangler` there is
an unpinned download. Its canonical form is in `OffChainRestore.md` §7b:

```bash
# [unrun here] — verified form, copied from OffChainRestore.md §7b
( cd ops/offchain-data-warm && npm ci && npm run deploy )
```

An earlier revision of this line pointed at `DeploymentRunbook.md`, which
contains no procedure for this Worker at all. Replacing an invented command
with a dangling reference is not an improvement, so the form is quoted here
with its source named.

## 1. What is being discarded, deliberately

A contract redeploy obsoletes almost all of it by definition — the rows
describe contracts that will no longer exist:

| table | rows | why it does not survive a redeploy |
|---|---|---|
| `activity_events` | 1,015 | events from the old contracts |
| `loan_participants` | 77 | old loans |
| `offers` / `loans` | 59 / 38 | old contracts |
| `webhook_deliveries` | 52 | dedupe state for old events |
| `notifications` | 22 | about old loans |
| `indexer_cursor` | 12 | block positions for the old deployment |
| `signed_offers` | 5 | address-bound to the old contracts; all cancelled |
| `liquidity_confidence` | 6 | streak state, rebuilt by observation |
| `market_summary` / `protocol_config` / `reward_loop_totals` | 5 / 3 / 3 | derived; recomputed |
| `notify_state` | 1 | dedupe state for notifications about old loans |
| `telegram_links` | 0 | already empty |

> **Taken 2026-08-03.** Both a standalone `support_tickets` export and a
> full-database export were pulled to `~/vaipakam-d1-export-2026-08-03/`
> (dir `700`, files `600`, outside the repo) and verified per-table against
> the live database. They are plaintext personal data — encrypt if they
> persist, `shred -u` when done. The full export carries `d1_migrations` and
> `sqlite_sequence`; filter both if it is ever imported into a database that

**Two exceptions, called out so they are choices rather than oversights.**

`user_thresholds` (1 row) is **not** obsoleted by a redeploy — an earlier
revision of this table said it was. It is per-wallet, per-chain alert
configuration with no loan identifier, and the same row carries the user's
Telegram chat id. A redeploy changes which contracts it watches, not the
user's stated preference. It is one row today; export it with the tickets if
that user's settings are worth keeping.

And the born-off-chain set is larger than this table shows: the classifier
also names `diag_errors`, `diag_legal_holds`, `diag_legal_hold_audit`,
`pre_grace_notify_state`, `telegram_links` and `recycle_day_backfill`. All
are empty today. **Re-run the counts across all nine on the day** — this
table is a dated observation, not a property, and a legal hold or a
diagnostic recorded between now and execution would not be visible in it.


`support_tickets` holds **4 rows, all `status=open`**. A support ticket is a
person waiting for a reply, and a contract redeploy does not change that. If
those are real, export that one table before starting:

```bash
install -m 700 -d ~/vaipakam-cutover        # [run] private directory FIRST
# [run]
(cd apps/indexer && npx wrangler d1 export "$SOURCE_DB" --remote --no-schema \
  --table support_tickets --output ~/vaipakam-cutover/tickets.sql -y)
chmod 600 ~/vaipakam-cutover/tickets.sql
```

**The directory is created private before wrangler writes.** Wrangler creates
the output with default permissions, so a `chmod` afterwards leaves a window
in which the plaintext is world-readable on a shared machine. Restricting the
containing directory first closes it; the file `chmod` is belt-and-braces.

**Outside the repository, deliberately.** An earlier revision wrote it to
`./tickets.sql` from `apps/indexer/` — a path no `.gitignore` rule covers, at
whatever permissions the process happened to use. A `git add -A` would have
committed support-ticket message bodies and email addresses. It contains
personal data: `chmod 600`, keep it only as long as needed, `shred -u` after.

## 2. Sequencing against the contract redeploy

**"Starts empty and captures new data only" is only true if the redeploy and
the artifact update land FIRST.**

`chainIndexer.ts:673-684` resolves a missing cursor to `deployBlock - 1` and
begins scanning from there. So if the bindings move while the artifacts still
name the current contracts, the freshly-deployed indexer replays **the
existing deployment** into the new database — exactly the data the owner
decided not to migrate, arriving by the back door and mixed with nothing to
distinguish it.

Two orders work, and one does not:

| order | result |
|---|---|
| redeploy contracts → update `deployments.json` → cutover | new database holds only new-contract data ✅ |
| cutover → redeploy → update artifacts | old-contract replay, then a second replay; the first is junk that must be cleared ✅ but wasteful |
| cutover while artifacts still point at the old contracts, and leave it | old-contract data accumulates indefinitely ❌ |

**Chosen 2026-08-03: the first** — redeploy contracts, update
`deployments.json`, then cut over.

**With one gap that must be closed deliberately.** Publishing the new
artifacts is itself a merge, so it auto-deploys the indexer — which is still
bound to the source. From that moment until the binding PR lands, the
indexer indexes the NEW contracts into the OLD database, and
`POST /signed-offers` accepts user orders into a database about to be
deleted.

Two ways to close it, and both are acceptable:

- **Land the artifact update and the binding change in the SAME PR.** There
  is no window at all, and the guard still enforces that all four bindings
  move together. Preferred.
- **Keep them separate and accept a short window**, using the same
  shortest-window discipline as the agent deploy: have the binding PR ready
  to merge the moment the artifact PR lands.

What is not acceptable is publishing artifacts and getting to the binding
change later — that is the state where user-submitted orders accumulate
somewhere they will not survive. If circumstances force the cutover first,
plan to clear the new database again afterwards and say so at the time,
rather than discovering a mixed dataset later.

## 3. The cutover

### Step 0 — clear the target

It is **not** empty. `vaipakam-warm` still holds the six rows hand-copied
during #1537's preparation — `user_thresholds` 1, `notify_state` 1,
`support_tickets` 4 (verified 2026-08-03). An earlier revision of this plan
had a clearing step; the no-migration rewrite removed it, which would have
left those stale rows to be adopted as live state.

```bash
# [unrun] — verify against OffChainRestore.md §1 before pasting
(cd apps/indexer && npx wrangler d1 execute "$TARGET_DB" --remote --command \
  "DELETE FROM user_thresholds; DELETE FROM notify_state; DELETE FROM support_tickets;")
```

**Then confirm the domain tables are empty.** Not *every* table: `d1_migrations`
necessarily holds 49 rows — that is what "prepared through `0048`" means — and
`sqlite_sequence` may hold rows too. An earlier revision asked for a state the
target cannot be in, which leaves an operator either blocked or deleting
bookkeeping they need.

### Step 0b — re-apply migrations if any landed since

The target was prepared through `0048`. **Neither changing a binding nor
`wrangler deploy` applies D1 migrations** — that is a separate command, and
on the deploy path it runs as its own phase. If any migration merged between
preparation and execution, the Workers will come up against a database
missing its schema.

```bash
# [run] — this exact form was used on the source today
(cd apps/indexer && npx wrangler d1 migrations apply "$TARGET_DB" --remote)
(cd apps/indexer && npx wrangler d1 migrations list "$TARGET_DB" --remote)   # expect none pending
```

### Step 1 — one PR, all four bindings

`apps/{indexer,keeper,agent}/wrangler.jsonc` and
`ops/offchain-data-warm/wrangler.jsonc`: set both `database_name` and
`database_id` to the replacement.

```
vaipakam-warm   e5e927cf-56c3-42c7-9820-179a235cc84f
```

`check-d1-name-consistency` is a required status check and fails unless all
four agree on both fields, so a partial switch cannot merge. That is the
protection worth having here: half-switched is the only genuinely bad state,
because migrations and reads would target different databases.

Update the docs that describe the live binding in the same PR — the same
check scans `wrangler d1` commands in scripts and runbooks.

### Step 2 — deploy the two that do not auto-deploy

`apps/indexer` and `apps/keeper` deploy automatically on merge.
**`apps/agent` and `ops/offchain-data-warm` do not** — no
`Workers Builds: vaipakam-agent` check appears on any recent main commit, and
its last deploy predates several merges.

```bash
pnpm --filter @vaipakam/agent exec wrangler deploy
# [unrun here] — verified form, from OffChainRestore.md §7b.
# NOT `npx wrangler` from the repo root: this package is outside the
# pnpm workspace, so that would be an unpinned download.
( cd ops/offchain-data-warm && npm ci && npm run deploy )
```

Do this in the same sitting as the merge. Until it is done, **agent reads and
writes the old database while the other two use the new one** — and that
split is user-visible, independently of the no-migration decision.

A threshold set, a Telegram link made, or a support ticket filed in that
window lands in the database about to be deleted. The user sees it succeed;
it then vanishes. "We are not migrating data" covers rows that a redeploy
obsoletes — it does not cover a write the user watched succeed minutes ago.

Two ways to close it, and the choice is the operator's:

- **Shortest window.** Have the `wrangler deploy` for agent ready to run
  before merging, and run it the moment the merge lands. The exposure is the
  couple of minutes it takes.
- **No window.** Put agent's mutating routes behind a `503` for the interval
  (unbind the route, or deploy a rejecting build), then restore them after
  the redeploy. A user who is told "try again shortly" has lost nothing; one
  whose ticket silently disappeared has.

**Chosen 2026-08-03: the shortest window.** Have the agent deploy ready to
run and execute it the moment the merge lands. Defensible pre-live, and the
exposure is a couple of minutes. If circumstances change — real users, a
support queue in use — revisit it rather than inheriting this line.

### Step 3 — confirm from behaviour, not configuration

`wrangler deployments list` prints deployment metadata, not bindings, and
happily shows an older successful deploy after a failed one. Confirm each
Worker is actually on the new database:

**The probe must distinguish the databases.** An earlier revision listed
checks that all pass against the OLD binding too — a keeper tick logs cleanly
either way, an agent request reads a schema-valid database either way, and
the backup Worker completes into whichever `B2_BUCKET` it holds. Those prove
the Worker is alive, not where it is pointed.

Use checks that can only be true of the new database. Since the target starts
empty, its emptiness is the discriminator:

```bash
# [unrun] — same shape as the [run] commands above; confirm before pasting.
# Before restoring traffic: the new database has zero rows in these.
(cd apps/indexer && npx wrangler d1 execute "$TARGET_DB" --remote --command \
  "SELECT (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM offers) o, (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM activity_events) a")
```

- **indexer** — after its first tick, `indexer_cursor` gains a row in
  `$TARGET_DB` and `offers`/`activity_events` begin filling *there*. Confirm
  the row count in the TARGET rose, not that the indexer merely ran.
- **keeper** — a write it owns appears in `$TARGET_DB`. Choose the table by
  what is actually true at the time: immediately after a fresh contract
  deployment `liquidity_confidence` may legitimately stay empty
  (`runLiquidityConfidence` returns before its upsert when there are no
  active collateral assets) and `hf_band_state` needs a loan to band. If
  neither can be provoked, **do not fall back to the tick's log line** — an
  earlier revision suggested that, and it is wrong: `passIsArmed` builds
  those lines purely from arming flags and logs `start` before the pass
  touches D1 at all. It tells you the pass ran, not where it wrote.

  The honest fallback is the control plane, labelled as such — a
  configuration check, not a behaviour one: read the Worker's D1 binding in
  the Cloudflare dashboard (*Settings → Bindings*), or via the API if you
  already have credentials to hand. It shows the bound database id, so it
  cannot be satisfied by the wrong database.

  Use it when no observable write is available, and prefer the write when one
  is.
- **agent** — perform one threshold write through the API, then read it back
  from `$TARGET_DB` directly. If it landed in the source instead, its manual
  deploy did not take.
- **backup Worker** — verified by **row counts**, not by the table list. It
  exports a fixed set of tables from whichever database it is bound to, so
  both manifests name the same tables and an earlier revision's "check the
  table list" would have passed either way. The manifest carries a
  `rowCount` per table: against the target those are ~0, against the source
  they are the old ~1,100. That is the discriminator.

## 4. Rollback

**Free until the Workers start writing to the target.** Until then the source
is untouched and current: revert the binding PR, redeploy `apps/agent` and
`ops/offchain-data-warm` by hand, done.

**After that it is not free, and this plan does not offer a clean one.**
New support tickets, thresholds, signed offers, notification state and
cursors exist only in the target. Reverting points every Worker back at a
source that is missing them, and the exports are plain `INSERT`s that collide
with the source's surviving rows — so a reverse import is not a one-liner
either.

If rollback is needed after that point, treat it as its own cutover with the
same care as the forward one. The honest planning assumption is: **once the
Workers write to the new database, forward is the only direction.**

## 5. Deleting the source

Order matters here, and this plan does not own all of it:

- [ ] **The old backup Worker is retired (#1551) — and #1551 has its own
      gate that comes first.** Its order is: the NEW Worker completes a
      nightly whose alert names the new bucket, *then* the old Worker is
      deleted. Only after that is the source database safe to delete, since
      the old Worker binds it as `DB_ARCHIVE` and would otherwise be left
      with a live cron pointed at nothing.

      An earlier revision of this checklist said "retired first" while
      listing the target's nightly verification two entries below, which
      inverted #1551's own sequence.
- [ ] All four Workers confirmed on the target by a **discriminating** probe.
- [ ] One nightly backup completed against the target, verified by content.
- [ ] **Both §1 exceptions decided** — `support_tickets` (4 open) and
      `user_thresholds` (1 row, per-wallet alert config carrying a Telegram
      chat id). Neither is obsoleted by a contract redeploy, and the discard
      check below does not cover them precisely because §1 excludes them.
- [ ] **The discard list re-validated on the day.** The row counts in §1 are
      from 2026-08-03 and the database is live. `diag_legal_holds` and its
      audit trail are classified born-off-chain and irrecoverable — they are
      empty today, and a legal hold recorded between now and execution would
      not be. Re-run the count before deleting; do not trust this table.

```bash
# [unrun] — irreversible; confirm the form before running
(cd apps/indexer && npx wrangler d1 delete "$SOURCE_DB")
```

> **Why a variable.** Once the bindings move, `check-d1-name-consistency` — a
> required check — treats `vaipakam-archive` as a database no binding uses,
> and it scans `wrangler d1 delete`. A literal name here fails CI on the very
> PR that retires it. The guard is right: a `d1` command naming an unbound
> database is the partial-cutover signature, so the plan parameterises rather
> than being exempted from its own check.

## 6. Note for whoever executes this

Migrations `0043`–`0048` were applied to `vaipakam-archive` on 2026-08-03
(43 → 49), which fixed the M5 backing block that had been dark in production.
That work is **not** wasted if the database is later deleted: it kept the
rollback target healthy, and it is why the M5 surface has been correct since.
