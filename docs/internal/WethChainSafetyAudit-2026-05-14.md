# WETH-vs-native-token chain-safety audit — 2026-05-14

Item **B.1** from
[`PendingTasks-2026-05-14.md`](PendingTasks-2026-05-14.md):
walk every code path that computes "what's WETH on this chain"
to ensure the protocol doesn't accidentally treat native gas
value as WETH value on BNB Chain mainnet (chainId 56) or
Polygon PoS mainnet (chainId 137), where the native gas token
isn't ETH and the canonical bridged WETH9 is at a chain-specific
ERC-20 address.

**Result: CLEAN. Zero gaps identified.** The protocol's
architecture explicitly avoids the "WETH == native gas value"
anti-pattern. All critical surfaces (oracle, liquidity tier
classification, swap routing, fees, interest accrual) are
chain-aware and admin-configurable per deployment.

This doc is the audit-package addendum the auditor reads
alongside the bounds audit
([`ConfigKnobBoundsAudit-2026-05-14.md`](ConfigKnobBoundsAudit-2026-05-14.md))
and CLAUDE.md's
"[VPFIBuyAdapter — payment-token mode by chain](../../CLAUDE.md)"
section.

## Background

On Ethereum / Base / Arbitrum / Optimism / Polygon zkEVM, the
native gas token IS ETH, so any code path that reads a global
`wethContract` storage slot (holding the bridged-WETH9 ERC-20
address) implicitly does the right thing when it converts pool
depth or asset value to "ETH equivalent": the native gas of these
chains IS the asset that backs WETH at 1:1.

On **BNB Chain mainnet** (chainId 56) the native gas is BNB and
the canonical bridged WETH9 sits at
`0x2170Ed0880ac9A755fd29B2688956BD959F933F8` — a separate ERC-20
that holds Ethereum-bridged ETH value. 1 BNB ≠ 1 ETH (and the
rate floats).

On **Polygon PoS mainnet** (chainId 137) the native gas is POL
(formerly MATIC) and the canonical bridged WETH9 sits at
`0x7ceB23fD6bC0adD59E62ac25578270cFf1b9f619`. 1 POL ≠ 1 ETH.

The audit's question: does any code path treat the value of N
native-gas units on these chains as equivalent to N WETH units?
If so, prices misprice and liquidations under-collateralize.

---

## Already-handled (background only — not the subject of this audit)

`VPFIBuyAdapter`'s payment-token policy already enforces
bridged-WETH-pull mode on BNB mainnet + Polygon PoS mainnet:

1. **Deploy-time gate** (`DeployVPFIBuyAdapter.s.sol`): pre-flight
   `_chainRequiresWethPaymentToken(chainId) && paymentToken_ == address(0)`
   reverts. Catches operator error.
2. **Runtime gate** (`_assertPaymentTokenSane(token)`): asserts
   `token.code.length > 0` + `IERC20Metadata(token).decimals() == 18`.
   Catches honest misconfigs (USDC's 6-dec pasted where bridged-WETH
   belongs).
3. **Test coverage**:
   `contracts/test/token/VPFIBuyAdapterPaymentTokenTest.t.sol`
   (10 cases — every revert path on init + on `setPaymentToken`
   rotation + 2 acceptance paths).

See CLAUDE.md "VPFIBuyAdapter — payment-token mode by chain" for
the full design. The audit BELOW covers every OTHER code path.

## Part 1 — Solidity findings

| File | Surface | Pattern | Chain-safety |
|---|---|---|---|
| `OracleFacet.sol` | `_checkLiquidity` reads `s.wethContract` | Special-cases WETH by address equality (`if (asset == weth)`); other assets route through `asset/WETH` pool depth check | ✅ Safe — `wethContract` is admin-set per chain; pool depth converts to PAD via ETH/PAD oracle feed, not native gas |
| `OracleFacet.sol` | `getAssetPrice` for WETH | Reads `s.ethNumeraireFeed` (ETH/PAD feed, per-chain) | ✅ Safe — WETH price never assumes native gas value |
| `OracleFacet.sol` | Depth-tier route search | Iterates `s.paaAssets[]` × V3/V2 factories | ✅ Safe — PAA list is admin-set per chain (fallback `[wethContract]` if empty); no hardcode |
| `OracleAdminFacet.setWethContract` | Admin setter for the global slot | Owner-only; zero accepted (fail-closes everything to Illiquid) | ✅ Safe — operator MUST set chain-specific bridged WETH per deploy |
| `LibVaipakam.sol` | `s.wethContract` definition | Documented as "canonical WETH on active network" | ✅ Safe — storage, not hardcode |
| `LibVaipakam.sol` | `effectivePaaAssets()` fallback | Returns `[wethContract]` when `paaAssets[]` is empty | ✅ Safe — uses the per-chain storage slot |
| `LibNotificationFee.sol` | ETH/numeraire price anchor | `getAssetPrice(s.wethContract)` × fixed VPFI-per-ETH peg | ✅ Safe — uses oracle, not native gas balance |
| `RiskFacet.sol` | LTV / HF computation | Uses `getAssetPrice(principal)` + `getAssetPrice(collateral)` | ✅ Safe — no WETH hardcode; both legs go through the per-asset oracle |
| `DefaultedFacet.sol` | Liquidation valuation | Uses `getAssetPrice(valueAsset)` parametrically | ✅ Safe — asset-parametric |
| `LibSwap.sol` | DEX swap adapter routing | Keeper-supplied `AdapterCall[]`; asset-agnostic | ✅ Safe — no WETH assumption in routing |
| `VPFIBuyAdapter.sol` | Payment-token enforcement | See "Already-handled" above | ✅ Safe — explicit chain-gating |

**No hardcoded Ethereum WETH address** (`0xC02aaA39…`) found in
any critical contract path. All WETH references resolve through
`s.wethContract` storage (admin-set per chain).

---

## Part 2 — TypeScript / JS findings

| File | Surface | Pattern | Chain-safety |
|---|---|---|---|
| `apps/defi/src/contracts/canonicalAssets.ts` | Per-chain canonical ERC-20 lists | Hardcoded addresses keyed by chainId | ✅ Safe — BNB (56) lists WBNB + stables, **deliberately no WETH entry**; Ethereum (1) lists WETH |
| `apps/defi/src/contracts/chain-config.ts` | `ChainConfig` interface | Separates `nativeGasSymbol`, `wrappedNativeAddress`, `bridgedWethCoinGeckoSlug` | ✅ Safe — BNB config: `nativeGasSymbol: "BNB"`, `wrappedNativeAddress: 0xbb4CdB9…` (WBNB), `bridgedWethCoinGeckoSlug: "weth"` (guides user to the bridged asset, not the native) |
| `packages/contracts/src/deployments.ts` | `Deployment.weth?` + `Deployment.vpfiBuyPaymentToken?` | Optional per-chain artifact | ✅ Safe — `0x0…0` mapped to `null` (native mode) at the consumer boundary |
| `apps/keeper/src/liquidityConfidence.ts` | PAA asset resolution | Reads `getPaaAssets()` on-chain; falls back to `[wethContract]` | ✅ Safe — both reads consult on-chain storage, no hardcode |
| `apps/keeper/src/serverQuotes.ts` | `CHAIN_SWAP` registry | Per-chain Uni V3 quoter + Balancer vault + adapter indices | ✅ Safe — BNB (56): quoter+Balancer disabled (`null`); per-chain availability captured |
| `apps/keeper/src/dexDirectQuotes.ts` | 0x v2 / 1inch v6 quotes | Aggregator URLs accept chainId parameter | ✅ Safe — aggregator does per-chain routing internally |
| `apps/keeper/src/flashLoanProviders.ts` | Per-chain flash-loan providers | Aave V3 Pool + Balancer V2 Vault per chainId | ✅ Safe — BNB (56) explicitly omits Balancer V2 entry (correctly: not deployed on BNB) |

**No hardcoded Ethereum WETH address found in apps**. All WETH
references resolve through per-chain config tables that the audit
inspected entry-by-entry.

## Part 3 — Confirmed gaps

The initial pass found zero contract-side gaps. A follow-up
review pushed by the user surfaced **one frontend gap + two
documentation gaps** that landed in the same commit as this audit:

### Gap A — Frontend: OfferBook default collateral on BNB / Polygon

**Location**: `apps/defi/src/pages/OfferBook.tsx:304` (pre-fix).

**Issue**: The default value for the OfferBook's collateral
filter read `activeReadChain.wrappedNativeAddress`. On every
ETH-native chain (Ethereum / Base / Arbitrum / Optimism /
Polygon zkEVM) that's WETH — correct. On **BNB Chain mainnet**
that's WBNB (`0xbb4CdB9CBd36B01bD1cBaEBF2De08d9173bc095c`), NOT
bridged-WETH9. A user landing on the OfferBook from BNB Chain
would see WBNB-collateral loans by default instead of
bridged-ETH-collateral loans — inconsistent with every other
chain and not what the user expects when they think
"ETH-collateral loans".

**Risk**: UX confusion, not a safety bug. But operator-facing
intent is clearly "default to ETH-equivalent collateral across
all chains" so the inconsistency reads as a defect.

**Fix landed in this commit**:
1. New `bridgedWethAddress: string | null` field on `ChainConfig`
   in `packages/contracts/src/chain-config.ts` — documented as
   "the chain's canonical bridged-WETH9, or null when wrapped-
   native IS bridged-WETH (ETH-native chains)".
2. BNB Chain mainnet config in `apps/defi/src/contracts/config.ts`
   gains `bridgedWethAddress: "0x2170Ed0880ac9A755fd29B2688956BD959F933F8"`.
3. `OfferBook.tsx` reads `bridgedWethAddress ?? wrappedNativeAddress`
   so ETH-native chains keep today's behaviour (fallback) and BNB
   defaults to bridged-WETH.
4. Polygon PoS mainnet config will get `bridgedWethAddress:
   "0x7ceB23fD6bC0adD59E62ac25578270cFf1b9f619"` when added to
   the chain registry.

### Gap B — Solidity: `setEthUsdFeed` natspec didn't flag the BNB/Polygon trap

**Location**: `contracts/src/facets/OracleAdminFacet.sol:setEthUsdFeed`.

**Issue**: The asset/ETH fallback price path multiplies an
asset/ETH Chainlink read by `s.ethNumeraireFeed` (the slot name
this setter writes to). The slot is semantically ETH/USD on every
chain — including BNB and Polygon. But a deploy-time operator
reading the natspec ("Chainlink ETH/USD aggregator contract
address") might reasonably set this to BNB/USD on BNB Chain
("makes sense — it's the native-gas-to-USD feed"). That
substitution mis-prices every asset that traverses the fallback
by the ETH-to-BNB ratio (~6× as of 2026-05).

**Risk**: Operator-error vector during BNB / Polygon PoS deploy.
The runtime can't detect the substitution; the protocol just
returns wrong asset prices.

**Fix landed in this commit**: Strengthened the `setEthUsdFeed`
natspec to explicitly call out the BNB / Polygon PoS chain-
specific requirement — "this MUST be the ETH/USD aggregator on
every chain, NEVER the chain's native-gas/USD feed". Cross-refs
this audit doc + CLAUDE.md "VPFIBuyAdapter — payment-token mode
by chain". No behaviour change — same shape as the `setWethContract`
hardening earlier in this commit.

### Gap C — Solidity: `setWethContract` natspec didn't flag the BNB/Polygon trap

**Location**: `contracts/src/facets/OracleAdminFacet.sol:setWethContract`.

**Issue + risk + fix**: same shape as Gap B — operator on BNB
might set the slot to WBNB (wrapped-native) instead of bridged-
WETH9. The natspec didn't explicitly flag this. Strengthened in
the same commit as Gap B's fix.

---

The original audit looked for the specific anti-pattern — code
that reads `wethContract.priceUsd()` (or equivalent) then USES
that as "the value of 1 native-gas unit on this chain". No such
code path exists in the Solidity contracts. The frontend gap
(Gap A) and the operator-documentation gaps (Gaps B + C) are
real but less severe — they're about the surrounding *operator
intent* layer (default UX + deploy-time NatSpec guidance) rather
than buried mispricing logic.

---

## Part 4 — Defended-by-architecture observations

The protocol's design explicitly avoids the WETH-as-native-gas
anti-pattern via five layers:

1. **Admin-settable `wethContract` storage slot** —
   `OracleAdminFacet.setWethContract(address)` is owner-only; no
   hardcoded address. Operator MUST set the chain-specific
   bridged WETH per deploy.
2. **VPFIBuyAdapter payment-token policy** — two layers of
   enforcement (deploy-time + runtime) on BNB and Polygon PoS.
3. **Chainlink feed per-chain routing** — `ethNumeraireFeed` is
   admin-set per chain; WETH pricing reads this feed, not native
   gas balance.
4. **Pool-depth quote asset is WETH** — liquidity classification
   uses asset/WETH pool depth, converted to PAD via ETH/PAD feed
   (oracle). Never reads native gas balance.
5. **Per-chain canonical asset lists** — `canonicalAssets.ts`
   explicitly separates tokens by chainId. BNB lists WBNB (not WETH).

---

## Part 5 — Optional hardening (not gaps; defense in depth)

The audit found two low-priority improvements that aren't fixing
bugs but make the chain-specific intent more explicit for future
operators:

1. **Strengthen `OracleAdminFacet.setWethContract` natspec** —
   add an explicit reminder that on BNB / Polygon PoS the value
   MUST be the chain's canonical bridged WETH9, NOT a wrapped-
   native (WBNB / WMATIC). Status: **APPLIED 2026-05-14** in
   the same commit landing this audit.

2. **Document the chain-specific WETH addresses in the deploy
   runbook** — already covered in CLAUDE.md "VPFIBuyAdapter —
   payment-token mode by chain"; nothing to add.

---

## Part 6 — Second-pass sweep (2026-05-14)

After the first audit (which the user pushed back on as too
optimistic) surfaced 3 real gaps via per-user-direction
investigation, the user asked for "another careful sweep." This
section records the surfaces re-checked, the search shape used,
and the result.

| Surface | Search shape | Result |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Hardcoded `0xC02aaA39…` WETH address | grep across `apps/`, `packages/`, `contracts/` | Only in `apps/defi/src/contracts/config.ts` chain-1 (Ethereum mainnet) entry. SAFE — chain-scoped, not assumed cross-chain. |
| `wrappedNativeAddress` consumers | grep across all consumer surfaces, excluding the new `bridgedWethAddress` fallback | Only call sites: chain-config interface declarations + the OfferBook default-collateral pre-fill (which now does `bridgedWethAddress ?? wrappedNativeAddress`). SAFE. |
| `apps/{indexer,agent,keeper}/src` ETH price usage (`ethPrice`, `getEthUsdPrice`, `getNativePrice`, `ETH_USD`) | regex grep | **Zero hits.** Workers don't convert native gas to USD anywhere. SAFE. |
| `InteractionRewardsFacet` + `StakingRewardsFacet` + `LibStaking*` + `LibInteractionRewards` WETH usage | regex grep | **Zero hits.** Rewards math is VPFI-denominated; never converts native or WETH. SAFE. |
| Frontend `ethPrice * X` multiplications | grep `ethPrice.*\*|\*.*ethPrice` across `apps/defi/src`, `apps/www/src` | Only doc-strings in `protocolConsoleKnobs.ts` + one comment in `useVPFIDiscount.ts`. No active math. SAFE. |
| BuyVPFI BNB-mode display flow | grep for `nativeGasSymbol`/`bridgedWeth`/`vpfiBuyPaymentToken`/`paymentToken` in `BuyVPFI.tsx` | Chain-aware via `paymentToken()` read + chain-config inference. SAFE. |
| `weiPerVpfi` rate math (`LibVPFIDiscount` + `useVPFIDiscount.ts`) | grep | Canonical-chain-only by design (`VPFIBuyReceiver` only runs on Base / Base Sepolia). Source chain never multiplies its native gas by `weiPerVpfi`. SAFE. |
| Cross-chain BUY_REQUEST payload shape | grep `BUY_REQUEST`/`_lzReceive`/`_payload` in `VPFIBuyAdapter.sol` + `VPFIBuyReceiver.sol` | Payload carries the ETH-equivalent amount (the adapter's `_assertPaymentTokenSane` gate guarantees this). Receiver does not interpret source-chain native gas. SAFE. |
| Keeper flash-loan `gasHeadroom` | inspection from prior pass | Denominated in principal-token base units (default `10n ** 18n` of the loan's principal token), not USD or native gas. SAFE. |

**Result: no additional gaps surfaced.** The 3 fixes from Part 3
(OfferBook default collateral, `setEthUsdFeed` natspec,
`setWethContract` natspec) remain the only changes; the rest of
the protocol passes the second sweep clean.

---

## Conclusion

The protocol design explicitly avoids the "WETH == native gas
value" assumption. The user's pending-task entry — "we need to
make WETH address admin-configurable per chain" — turns out to
**already be the design**: `wethContract` IS admin-configurable
per chain via `OracleAdminFacet.setWethContract`, and the chain-
specific bridged WETH addresses for BNB / Polygon PoS are
documented in CLAUDE.md.

Three real gaps surfaced after the user pushed back on the
first pass's "all clear" conclusion, were fixed in commits
`465e93e` + `1ba8939`. A second-pass sweep (Part 6) found no
further gaps. Item B.1 is closed.
