## #1566 slice 4 PR A — a dedicated custody address for delivered reward funding, deployed dark (PR #2158)

The reward funding delivered to a chain used to sit in the Diamond's own token
balance, beside every other VPFI the Diamond touches. Slice 4 of the #1566
design moves it to a dedicated custody address the Diamond owns, so that what
backs reward payouts is one balance an observer can read and no other path can
spend by accident. This first of three slice-4 changes puts that address and
its lifecycle in place without moving any value: no payout, gate or funding
path reads it yet, and nothing can put value into it. A fresh deployment
constructs and binds its holder while still paused and records the address in
the deployment artifact; a live chain gets one through a dedicated one-shot
script after the facet refresh, because a refresh must never deploy or
re-point a holder. Replacing a holder is its own paused ceremony: the old
holder's whole balance moves to the successor and the Diamond's pointer flips
in the same transaction, refusing if the successor cannot account for exactly
what was released.

The holder keeps no ledger. Which part of its balance is live fresh funding,
recycled value, a stranded recovery, a Detached era's pending surplus and so on
is recorded in Diamond storage, credited and debited only by the Diamond; those
writers arrive with the cutover change, so on this change every row reads zero
and the read surface says when a balance cannot be read at all rather than
reporting it as empty. Keeping the ledger out of the holder is what makes the
holder replaceable at any size.

The change also lands the paid-side migration the design requires for chains
carrying history that closure 2 now charges: a paused, admin-only, one-shot
rebase that installs a reconstructed absolute total as a floor, never lowering
what the counter already holds, and on the canonical chain sets the received
side to the same figure so a no-provenance deployment starts from zero headroom
rather than negative headroom. It consumes the older additive seed as well as
its own guard, so a stale seed can never add historical value on top of an
absolute total. A fresh deployment consumes both guards at deploy, exactly as
the seed already was, so neither migration writer can run on a chain with no
history to import. Refs #1566, #1349, #1956.
