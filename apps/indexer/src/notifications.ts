/**
 * In-app notification center (#1213 / E-11) — the write-side
 * materialization, PR 1.
 *
 * `materializeNotifications` runs on the ingest scan tail, right after
 * `activity_events` is written, and derives per-RECIPIENT inbox rows
 * (table `notifications`, migration 0038) from the loan-lifecycle
 * events already decoded in the scan. The connected app then renders a
 * free wallet-native inbox from a plain `WHERE recipient = ?` read.
 *
 * Design (docs/DesignsAndPlans/InAppNotificationCenterDesign.md):
 *   - One row per (recipient wallet, notification). A both-parties
 *     event materializes two rows.
 *   - Recipients resolve to the CURRENT position-NFT holder
 *     (`*_current_owner`) at materialization time — the design's
 *     ownership discipline (a secondary-market buyer is notified, an
 *     exited seller and a burned/cash-satisfied side are not). See
 *     `recipientFor` for the exact cases this gets right.
 *   - Idempotent: every row carries a deterministic `dedup_key`; a
 *     re-scan / catch-up re-runs `INSERT OR IGNORE` with no duplicates.
 *   - Truncation-free: this is a bounded per-scan derivation (a scan
 *     has a bounded log count), not a capped hint.
 *
 * This PR ships every loan-lifecycle TERMINAL/repay row (matched,
 * partial repay, and each distinct repaid / defaulted / liquidated /
 * internal-match close-out — the contracts emit several of these under
 * their own terminal event with no generic LoanRepaid/LoanDefaulted
 * companion, so each is mapped explicitly). Offer-matched,
 * periodic-interest, secondary-market transfers, the time-based calendar
 * rows (maturity / grace) and the liquid-only HF-band rows are follow-ups
 * — each source event is consciously deferred in
 * `NOTIF_DELIBERATELY_NOT_HANDLED` (the coverage guardrail enforces that
 * every loan/offer state-change event is mapped OR allowlisted).
