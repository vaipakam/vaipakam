/**
 * How a failed RPC call the PAGE made should be classified by a driver
 * that distinguishes BLOCKED from FAIL.
 *
 * Three outcomes, because the two-way split the drive started with put a
 * real app defect in the same bucket as a flaky network:
 *
 *   'answered'     the EVM ran and rejected the call — a revert. Ordinary
 *                  application-level information; the app is expected to
 *                  handle it and the drive judges the page as normal.
 *   'client-fault' the provider RECEIVED the request and rejected it as
 *                  malformed. That is a positive answer about the
 *                  endpoint — reachable, working — and the fault is the
 *                  PAGE's. It must reach the drive as a product FAIL.
 *   'unreachable'  no answer: rate limited, unavailable, an internal
 *                  provider error, a dead socket. Infrastructure, so the
 *                  drive can conclude nothing about the app.
 *
 * The 'answered' test is an ALLOWLIST on purpose, and the reasoning is
 * the same one `ALLOWED_RPC` is built on: an omission becomes a false
 * BLOCKED, which is loud and harmless, where a denylist's omission
 * becomes a false FAIL blamed on the app. Measured shapes:
 *
 *   revert            RpcRequestError             code=3       answered
 *   revert as -32000  InvalidInputRpcError        code=-32000  answered (bytes)
 *   invalid params    InvalidParamsRpcError       code=-32602  client-fault
 *   rate limited      LimitExceededRpcError       code=-32005  unreachable
 *   unavailable       ResourceUnavailableRpcError code=-32002  unreachable
 *   internal          InternalRpcError            code=-32603  unreachable
 *   unreachable / 503 HttpRequestError            code=absent  unreachable
 *
 * 'client-fault' is the round-21 addition. Before it, a page sending
 * malformed parameters produced `-32602`, was filed as "could not fetch",
 * and the drive exited 2 — reporting an app-generated bad request as an
 * infrastructure problem, and hiding the regression the drive exists to
 * catch.
 *
 * Only the three JSON-RPC codes that mean "your request was malformed"
 * are client faults. `-32601` (method not found) is deliberately NOT one:
 * it describes the SERVER's capability surface, not the request's
 * well-formedness, and a provider that genuinely does not implement a
 * method is an infrastructure fact about that endpoint.
 *
 * Everything is read off the error CHAIN rather than the top-level
 * object, because viem wraps the provider's error and the code and revert
 * data usually sit on an inner cause.
