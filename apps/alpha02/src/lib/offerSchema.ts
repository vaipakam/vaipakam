/**
 * Issue #165 Phase 1 — role-asymmetric UI LABELS over single-value
 * payloads.
 *
 * The user enters ONE value per field; the form labels in
 * `CreateOffer.tsx` are role-asymmetric per ADR-0010 §17.1 (lender
 * thinks "Lend up to X", borrower thinks "Borrow at least Y"), but the
 * **contract payload ships single-value** with the user's headline
 * number in the floor field and the `*Max` ceilings auto-collapsed to
 * zero. The contract reads `*Max == 0` as "treat as single-value at
 * the floor".
 *
 * Why NOT the ADR-0010 §17.1 split-floor/ceiling mapping yet:
 *
 * ADR-0010's mapping table (lender's `amount = 1 wei` + `amountMax = X`;
 * borrower's `collateralAmount = 0` + `collateralAmountMax = W`;
 * borrower's `interestRateBps = 0`; etc.) was written assuming the
 * `OfferMatchFacet.matchOffers` path is the canonical match flow.
 * The contract still exposes `OfferAcceptFacet.acceptOffer` for
 * single-match direct accepts — that path reads `offer.amount`,
 * `offer.interestRateBps`, and `offer.collateralAmount` DIRECTLY (see
 * `_acceptOffer`'s `matchOverride.active == false` branch). Shipping
 * the ADR split-mapping breaks the direct-accept path: e.g., a lender
 * offer with `amount = 1 wei` lets a borrower call `acceptOffer` and
 * walk away with a 1-wei loan; a borrower offer with `interestRateBps
 * = 0` is accepted at 0 % APR; a borrower offer with `collateralAmount
 * = 0` is direct-accepted without pulling any collateral. Codex
 * round-1 on PR #175 caught all of these as P1s.
 *
 * Phase 1 of #165 (this code) ships:
 *   - role-asymmetric LABELS in the form (the UX shift)
 *   - single-value payloads (the safe contract shape — both
 *     match paths land at the same loan terms)
 *
 * Phase 2 of #165 (now landed as #183 / PR #184) ships the role-aware
 * `_acceptOffer` reads + drops the create-time auto-collapse. The
 * frontend now ships **canonical role-asymmetric values**:
 *
 *   - Lender posts "I'll lend up to X" → `amountMax = X`,
 *     `amount = max(1, X × 10 / 100)` (the minPartialFillAmount default
 *     per design §2.3).
 *   - Lender posts "rate ≥ Y%" → `interestRateBps = Y`,
 *     `interestRateBpsMax = MAX_INTEREST_BPS` (no upper limit).
 *   - Lender collateral stays single-value (`collateralAmount ==
 *     collateralAmountMax`) — see #164 design "Lender side stays
 *     single-value because the lender's collateralAmount IS their
 *     derived requirement".
 *   - Borrower posts "need at least X" → `amount = X`. `amountMax`
 *     ships equal to `amount` for Phase 2 (single-value direct-accept
 *     locks at the borrower's floor; range borrower offers will lift
 *     this when the frontend exposes range inputs).
 *   - Borrower posts "rate ≤ Y%" → `interestRateBpsMax = Y`,
 *     `interestRateBps = 0` (no lower limit — borrower accepts any
 *     rate below their ceiling).
 *   - Borrower collateral: `collateralAmount = X`, `collateralAmountMax
 *     = X` (single-value; Phase 2 frontend doesn't yet expose the max
 *     commit range — borrowers post a single value).
 *
 * The `_acceptOffer` role-aware reads (LoanFacet §3 of the design)
 * give the loan the right terms whichever side direct-accepts. The
 * canonical mapping is now safe.

 * offer from the LIVE old loan (T-092-H atomic path). The wire rules
 * this encodes, all contract-enforced:
 *   - AON fill + `amount == amountMax == oldLoan.principal` exactly
 *     (LibAutoRefinanceCheck requires `amount ≤ principal ≤ amountMax`
 *     and AON requires a single-value amount).
 *   - Asset continuity: lending/collateral/prepay assets and the
 *     collateral asset type must equal the old loan's.
 *   - Collateral identity repeated EXACTLY (amount/tokenId/quantity,
 *     single-value) so the old collateral CARRIES OVER — nothing is
 *     pulled at create and the lien re-tags old→new at accept.
 *   - Borrower rate mapping: `interestRateBps = 0`,
 *     `interestRateBpsMax = <ceiling>` — same shape as the standard
 *     borrower post flow.
 * Values come from the on-chain loan (wei-native), never from form
 * strings — no decimals scaling here.
